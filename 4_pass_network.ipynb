   "source": "## Summary: Pass Network Analysis\n\n### What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook constructs a pass network graph for Cote d'Ivoire in a match, using StatsBomb event data processed through the `mplsoccer` `Sbopen` parser. A pass network represents a team's positional structure and inter-player passing relationships as a graph: players are nodes positioned at their average touch location, and edges between them are weighted by the number of completed passes exchanged.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **`Sbopen` parser**: mplsoccer's built-in StatsBomb parser returns four typed DataFrames (`df`, `related`, `freeze`, `tactics`) from a single call. The `df` DataFrame uses normalized column names (`type_name`, `outcome_name`, `team_name`) rather than the raw StatsBomb JSON keys, making filtering more readable.\n- **Successful passes only** (`outcome_name.isnull()`): In the StatsBomb model, a pass with a non-null `outcome_name` (e.g. \"Incomplete\", \"Out\") is a failed pass. Only passes where `outcome_name` is null are completed. Including failed passes would add noise and misrepresent the team's actual ball circulation.\n- **Pre-substitution filter**: Restricting events to `index < sub` (the first substitution) ensures the network exclusively represents the starting eleven. Including substitute minutes inflates the pass counts of players who came on late at the expense of those who were substituted off.\n- **Average touch position as node location**: The centroid of all pass initiations and receptions for a player is a standard approximation of their positional role. Using both directions (as passer and as recipient) is more stable than either alone and reflects the player's full area of involvement.\n- **Canonical pair key via sorting**: `\"_\".join(sorted([p1, p2]))` collapses directed edges into undirected ones. This aggregates A→B and B→A together, which is appropriate for measuring the total communication volume between any pair of players.\n- **Proportional edge width**: `line_width = pass_count / max_pass_count * 10` encodes relationship strength directly in the visual weight of each edge, making dominant passing lanes immediately identifiable without a legend.\n\n### Data Available\n\n| DataFrame | Content |\n|---|---|\n| `scatter_df` | Player name, average x/y position, pass count, normalized marker size |\n| `lines_df` | Pair key and pass count for all pairs with more than 2 completed passes |\n| `df_pass` | Full filtered pass records with origin/destination coordinates and player names |\n\n### Ideas to Extract More Value\n\n- **Directed edges**: Split `pair_key` into separate A→B and B→A edges to identify asymmetric relationships. A high-volume directed edge from a midfielder to a forward with no return edge suggests a target man role and one-way supply dependency.\n- **Betweenness centrality**: Apply graph-theoretic centrality measures using `networkx.betweenness_centrality()` on the pass network graph to identify structural connectors. A player with high betweenness sits on the most shortest paths between teammates — their removal or pressing disrupts ball circulation most.\n- **Formation recovery from node positions**: Apply k-means clustering (`k=4` for a back four, etc.) to the `scatter_df` x/y coordinates to infer the team's actual spatial shape and compare it against the listed formation in the `tactics` DataFrame.\n- **Multi-match network comparison**: Build pass networks for the same team across multiple matches and measure the Euclidean distance between each player's average position vectors. Low variance signals tactical consistency; high variance indicates positional flexibility or tactical shifts between matches.\n- **Progressive pass filtering**: Restrict `df_pass` to passes that advance the ball at least 10 yards toward the opposition goal (or into the final third) before building the network. This produces a \"progression network\" that reveals which players drive the team's forward play.\n- **xT (Expected Threat) edge weighting**: Assign an Expected Threat value to each pass based on its start and end zone and weight edges by cumulative xT rather than raw count. This reframes the network from \"who passes most\" to \"which connections generate the most attacking threat.\""
