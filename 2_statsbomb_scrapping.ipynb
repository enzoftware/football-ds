   "source": "## Summary: StatsBomb Open Data Exploration\n\n### What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook introduces the StatsBomb Open Data dataset via the `statsbombpy` library. It covers the three-level discovery hierarchy — competitions, matches, events — and demonstrates how to load the full event stream for a single match and reduce its wide-format structure to the columns relevant for further analysis.\n\nStatsBomb Open Data provides free, high-resolution event-level tracking for selected competitions, making it the standard entry point for academic and independent football data science work.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **StatsBomb event model**: Every discrete on-ball action (pass, shot, press, carry, dribble, tackle, etc.) is recorded as one row. The model is exhaustive — over 80 columns capture attributes across all event types, most of which are NaN for any given row.\n- **Coordinate system**: StatsBomb uses a 120 x 80 yard pitch model. Origin `(0, 0)` is the bottom-left corner from the perspective of the home team. All `location` and `pass_end_location` values are in this system.\n- **Wide format**: The events DataFrame is intentionally sparse. Downstream analysis always starts by filtering rows to a specific event type (e.g. `type == 'Pass'`) and then selecting only the relevant columns.\n- **`tactics` column**: Populated only for `Starting XI` and `Tactical Shift` events. It contains a nested dict with the team's formation code and the full lineup, including each player's listed position — the primary source for formation data.\n\n### Data Available\n\n| Function | Output |\n|---|---|\n| `sb.competitions()` | 75 competition/season entries in the open data catalog |\n| `sb.matches(competition_id, season_id)` | Full match list with metadata: teams, score, stadium, referee, managers |\n| `sb.events(match_id)` | Complete event stream — 4,019 events for Colombia vs England (WC 2018 R16) |\n\n### Ideas to Extract More Value\n\n- **Sequence reconstruction**: The `related_events` column (available in the full unfiltered DataFrame) links events that are part of the same possession sequence. Traversing these links enables pre-shot sequence analysis and possession chain modeling.\n- **Tactics column parsing**: Extract the `tactics` column for `Starting XI` events and normalize the nested lineup dicts to get each player's position, enabling formation-level analysis and role classification.\n- **Pressing intensity (PPDA)**: Filter to `type == 'Pressure'` events and count them against opponent passes in the defensive half. PPDA (Passes Per Defensive Action) is a widely used metric to quantify pressing aggressiveness.\n- **Player heatmaps**: Using the `location` field across all events for a single player produces an activity heatmap that reveals positional tendencies and zone of influence within the team's shape.\n- **Multi-match player profiles**: Join `sb.events()` across all matches in a competition to build per-player season aggregates: total xG generated and conceded, pass accuracy, progressive carries, defensive actions per 90.\n- **Under-pressure passing accuracy**: The `under_pressure` column flags events executed while being pressured. Comparing pass accuracy under pressure vs not under pressure is a reliable proxy for a player's composure on the ball."
