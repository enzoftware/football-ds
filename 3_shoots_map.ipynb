   "source": "## Summary: Shot Map Visualization with xG Encoding\n\n### What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook constructs a progressive shot map visualization using StatsBomb event data and the `mplsoccer` library. It starts from an empty pitch and builds toward a team-filtered, xG-encoded scatter plot that communicates both shot location and shot quality in a single view.\n\nThe canonical use case for this visualization is post-match reporting, opponent scouting, and identifying patterns in a team's attacking output over a season.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **VerticalPitch with `half=True`**: Renders only the attacking half in portrait orientation. This is the standard layout for shot maps because it concentrates visual attention on the final third and goal-threatening areas, making spatial patterns immediately readable.\n- **xG (Expected Goals)**: A model-derived probability (0–1) that a given shot results in a goal, conditioned on factors including: distance from goal, angle to goal, body part used, play pattern (open play vs set piece), and whether the shot followed a dribble. StatsBomb's xG model is one of the most detailed publicly available.\n- **Size encoding for xG**: Mapping `statsbomb_xg` to the `s` parameter (`xg * 500 + 100`) is a standard technique in football visualization. It encodes a second dimension (quality) into the same plot as location, avoiding the need for a color bar or separate legend. The linear scale ensures the ratio between chance qualities is preserved visually.\n- **`pitch.scatter()`**: A wrapper around `matplotlib`'s scatter that handles the coordinate transformation required by the pitch orientation, simplifying the mapping from StatsBomb coordinates to the rendered axes.\n\n### Data Available\n\nThe `df` DataFrame contains all shot events for match `3923881` with the following key columns:\n\n| Column | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `start_location_x/y` | Shot origin in StatsBomb 120x80 coordinates |\n| `end_location_x/y/z` | Final ball position; `z` (height) is populated for shots on target |\n| `statsbomb_xg` | Expected goals probability per shot |\n| `outcome` | Goal, Saved, Blocked, Off T, Wayward, Post |\n| `team`, `player` | Attribution for each shot |\n| `play_pattern` | Context: Regular Play, From Corner, From Free Kick |\n\n### Ideas to Extract More Value\n\n- **Outcome color coding**: Map `outcome` to distinct colors (e.g. green for Goal, amber for Saved, red for off target) to visually distinguish scoring shots from misses without adding a separate plot.\n- **Shot zone aggregation**: Divide the pitch into standard zones (six-yard box, penalty spot area, edge of box, outside box) using x/y thresholds and compute total xG and conversion rate per zone to identify team strengths and weaknesses by area.\n- **xGOT (Expected Goals on Target)**: Use `end_location_y` and `end_location_z` to map on-target shots onto a goal frame graphic, revealing which areas of the goal are most frequently targeted and where saves are being made.\n- **Multi-match shot accumulation**: Call `get_dataframe(event_type='shot')` across all matches in a competition and concatenate the results into a single DataFrame to produce a season-level shot profile, revealing attacking patterns and set-piece dependence.\n- **Goalkeeper save map**: Filter to `outcome == 'Saved'` and plot the `end_location_y` / `end_location_z` values on a goal-frame coordinate system to show the distribution of saves across the goal frame — a useful tool for goalkeeper performance analysis.\n- **Shot quality vs volume comparison**: Compute average xG per shot (quality) and total shot volume per team across a league season and plot them as a scatter to classify teams: high-quality/low-volume finishers vs high-volume/low-quality approaches.",
